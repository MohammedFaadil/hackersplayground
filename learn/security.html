            through various measures. Key components include firewalls, intrusion detection systems, VPNs, and access
            control mechanisms. Common threats encompass malware, denial-of-service attacks, and phishing, necessitating
            countermeasures like strong security policies, regular updates, and user training.</p>
        <p><strong>Cryptography</strong> is the science of securing information through encryption, ensuring that only
            authorized parties
            can access it. It includes symmetric key cryptography (using the same key for encryption and decryption) and
            asymmetric key cryptography (using a pair of keys). Key concepts also include hash functions and digital
            signatures. Threats to cryptography include key management issues and cryptanalysis, with countermeasures
            focusing on using strong algorithms and secure key management practices.</p>
