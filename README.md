# Hacker's Playground

**Hacker's Playground** is an interactive educational game designed to teach users about cybersecurity best practices and raise awareness of common cyber threats in a fun, engaging way. In today’s digital landscape, individuals are increasingly vulnerable to a variety of cyber attacks, from phishing and malware to social engineering and data breaches. Despite the growing risks, there is a gap in accessible and engaging resources that can effectively educate people on how to protect themselves online. **Hacker's Playground** addresses this need by transforming cybersecurity learning into an enjoyable game experience.

Players are presented with challenges such as recognizing phishing emails, creating strong passwords, avoiding malware, and identifying social engineering tactics. Each level in the game introduces a different cybersecurity concept, progressively increasing in difficulty to reinforce learning and retention. Players earn points, badges, and other rewards as they successfully navigate each level, making learning feel rewarding and motivating them to develop a strong foundation in cybersecurity.
